A basic tutorial on Docker + Django + Nginx + uWSGI + Postgres - From Scratch

This guide teaches you how to build a Django + Nginx + uWSGI + PostgreSQL environment using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) üìù

For those unfamiliar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), it's recommended to first read my previous guide:

## Introduction

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gDcSwcs.png)

I've covered this before, so I won't repeat it here :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Please refer to:

[Docker Beginners Guide - A tutorial on building Django + PostgreSQL with Docker üìù](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-tutorial)

### [Django](https://github.com/django/django)

Please refer to:

[Django Beginners Guide üìù](https://github.com/twtrubiks/django-tutorial)

[Django-REST-framework Beginners Guide üìù](https://github.com/twtrubiks/django-rest-framework-tutorial)

For more Django examples, you can check out my [Github](https://github.com/twtrubiks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=Django&type=&language=). I'll just list two basic ones here :relaxed:

### [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

![](https://i.imgur.com/RrNtbfz.png)

### [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)

![](https://i.imgur.com/AkcCtDa.png)

Nginx is a web server known for its low resource consumption and high stability. Regarding its stability, Nginx solved the **C10K** problem. What is **C10K**? You can read the original article here: [The C10K problem](http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html).

**C10K** stands for 10,000 clients. In the past, a server might fail to provide services properly if the number of concurrent client connections exceeded 10,000.

Nginx itself cannot handle dynamic content, so we must configure [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to handle the interaction. Refer to the flow below (Important):

:star: the web client <-> the web server (Nginx) <-> unix socket <-> uWSGI <-> Django :star:

You might be asking, what is uWSGI? :confused:

uWSGI is a communication protocol. You can think of it as an interface for communicating with Django. Typically, a Django application is hosted on an HTTP server (like Nginx). When the server receives a request, how does it pass (or convert) this data to Django?

That's the function of uWSGI :wink:

So why do we still need Nginx? :confused:

First, understand this concept:
Nginx is responsible for static content (HTML, JS, CSS, images, etc.), while uWSGI is responsible for Python's dynamic content.

uWSGI is not very good at handling static content (poor performance), so we can use Nginx to handle it. Using Nginx also has many other benefits:

* Nginx handles static resources better than uWSGI.
* Nginx can be configured with a caching mechanism.
* Nginx can be set up as a reverse proxy.
* Nginx can perform load balancing across multiple machines.

Friendly reminder :heart:

If you want to learn more about **reverse proxies**, you can refer to the explanation in [Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uwsgi-postgres-load-balance-tutorial#%E6%AD%A3%E5%90%91%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E5%99%A8--vs-%E5%8F%8D%E5%90%91%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E5%99%A8) :smile:

At this point, you might ask:
Why don't I need Nginx and uWSGI when developing locally? :confused:

When developing Django, we usually run it with `python manage.py runserver`. When you execute this command, it actually creates a small HTTP server for you. Of course, this is just for development convenience; it's not used in a production environment (not to mention the performance issues :disappointed_relieved:).

Wait :confused: I've heard of something called Gunicorn. I remember you mentioned it before in:
[Deploying_Django_To_Heroku_Tutorial](https://github.com/twtrubiks/Deploying_Django_To_Heroku_Tutorial)
[Deploying-Flask-To-Heroku](https://github.com/twtrubiks/Deploying-Flask-To-Heroku)

So why use uWSGI instead of Gunicorn?

At that time, I used Gunicorn because Heroku's official documentation recommended it for starting the web server. As for whether Gunicorn or uWSGI is better, I think it depends on your specific use case :wink:

Hold on, since we're talking about Nginx, isn't there also [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)? I hear a lot of people use that :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Some might ask, should I choose [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)? :confused:

I believe there is no "best" server. The key is to choose the one that best fits your needs and scenario :smiley:

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, I will use Docker to create 3 containers: Nginx, Django + uWSGI, and Postgres.

I'm mainly following this tutorial: [https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html), but with some minor differences :smirk:

The focus will be on the configuration of Nginx and Django + uWSGI.

**For the Nginx part**, refer to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/Dockerfile) in the Nginx folder.

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY my_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/

RUN mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\
    && ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# RUN mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\
#     && ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\
#     && rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Let's explain the steps inside:

First step:
Copy `nginx.conf` to the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` path.
(The original `nginx.conf` can be obtained from a Docker Nginx container, under the `/etc/nginx` path.)
I've copied an original version for you here: [nginx_origin.conf](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/nginx_origin.conf) :smiley:

Two main parts are modified in `nginx.conf`.
One part is changing the user from `nginx` to `root`.
```conf
user  root;
```
The other part is:
```conf
# include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
include /etc/nginx/sites-available/*;
```
Add the line `include /etc/nginx/sites-available/*;` and comment out `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;`.
This way, the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/Dockerfile) in the Nginx folder doesn't need to execute the command to delete `default.conf`, because `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;` is the default page that runs, but we want to set up our own :smirk:

Second step:
Copy `my_nginx.conf` into `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`.
Let's pause here for a moment.
If you install Nginx using `FROM nginx:latest`, you'll find that you don't have the following two paths:
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
But don't worry, if they don't exist, we create them ourselves (which is what the command in the Nginx Dockerfile does).
But why don't we have these paths? :confused:
The reason is that these default paths seem to be created only when Nginx is installed via `apt-get`.

Third step:
The `sites-available` folder isn't actually that important; you can name it whatever you like. However, the *sites-enabled* folder is more important because we need to use the Symlink method (via the `ln` command in Linux) to link *sites-enabled* and *my_nginx.conf*.

Next, let's talk about the settings in `my_nginx.conf`:
```conf
# the upstream component nginx needs to connect to
upstream uwsgi {
    # server api:8001; # use TCP
    server unix:/docker_api/app.sock; # for a file socket
}

# configuration of the server
server {
    # the port your site will be served on
    listen    80;
    # index  index.html;
    # the domain name it will serve for
    # substitute your machine's IP address or FQDN
    server_name  twtrubiks.com www.twtrubiks.com;
    charset     utf-8;

    client_max_body_size 75M;   # adjust to taste

    # Django media
    # location /media  {
    #     alias /docker_api/static/media;  # your Django project's media files - amend as required
    # }

    location /static {
        alias /docker_api/static; # your Django project's static files - amend as required
    }

    location / {
        uwsgi_pass  uwsgi;
        include     /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params; # the uwsgi_params file you installed
    }
}
```
You can also use the following commands to initially test if the nginx configuration is correct:
```cmd
nginx -t
# or
nginx -T
```
`-t` means test configuration and exit.
`-T` means test configuration, dump it and exit.

First, let's look at the `upstream` part. Using Unix sockets is better than using a TCP port socket because it has less overhead.

Next is the `include /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params` part. Generally, you can find `uwsgi_params` in the Nginx path `/etc/nginx/`. If you really can't find it, you can copy it from here: [uwsgi_params](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/api/uwsgi_params).
(I've copied a version for everyone; if you follow my steps, you should have it.)

Next, I need to explain `uwsgi_pass`. You might have seen `proxy_pass` instead. Nginx will convert the received request according to the uwsgi protocol and then forward it to Django for processing.
So why use uwsgi specifically instead of just proxy (which defaults to the http protocol)? :confused:
The main reason is performance.

Since we're on this topic, let's briefly explain what a **Proxy server** is.
Generally known as a proxy server, when a user from an external network sends a request, the Proxy server forwards this request to a server on the internal network for processing. After processing, the response is sent back to the external user through the Proxy server.
What are the benefits of this? :confused: The benefit is that it can protect the internal server's security, preventing users from directly attacking the server. Other benefits include caching mechanisms; if a user accesses the same data again, it can be retrieved directly from the cache.

Final step,
Friendly reminder :heart:
What is a daemon? :question::question::question:
You don't need to overthink it; simply think of it as a service :smile:
If you want to understand daemons more deeply, please google **linux daemon** :pencil2:

Why start Nginx with `nginx -g daemon off` instead of the usual `/etc/init.d/nginx start`? :confused:
This question takes us back to Docker.
The following is from the [Docker Nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) documentation:
***If you add a custom CMD in the Dockerfile, be sure to include -g daemon off; in the CMD in order for nginx to stay in the foreground, so that Docker can track the process properly (otherwise your container will stop immediately after starting)!***
Simply put, this keeps the Nginx service running; otherwise, the container will exit and stop.

**For the Django + uWSGI part**, refer to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/api/Dockerfile) in the `api` folder.
It's quite simple, but there's one thing I want to mention. Sometimes `pip install` is very slow.
You can consider adding `-i` to change the source and speed up the download :grin:

Next, let's explain `uwsgi.ini`, which contains some configuration settings:
```ini
[uwsgi]

# http=0.0.0.0:8000
socket=app.sock
master=true
# maximum number of worker processes
processes=4
threads=2
# Django's wsgi file
module=django_rest_framework_tutorial.wsgi:application

# chmod-socket=664
# uid=www-data
# gid=www-data

# clear environment on exit
vacuum          = true
```
It communicates with Nginx via a socket file (`app.sock`). `uid` and `gid` are for permissions.
You can refer to this article for an explanation, which mentions not using root permissions:
[Things to know (best practices and „Äåissues„Äç) READ IT !!!](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ThingsToKnow.html)

I ultimately chose to run it as root because without root, I encountered permission errors.
I finally found the answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18480201/ubuntu-nginx-emerg-bind-to-0-0-0-080-failed-13-permission-denied):
*the socket API bind() to a port less than 1024, such as 80 as your title mentioned, need root access.*
The simpler solution is to run it as root :smile:

Finally, we use `docker-compose.yml` to manage these containers.
You can directly refer to [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

## Execution Steps

Directly run `docker-compose up` and witness the magic.

You will see something like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/4WPac2V.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/I67WDJU.png)

If you see the following, it means success:

![](https://i.imgur.com/WwRLm4C.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/G28IGca.png)

Next, browse to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
If you successfully see the following screen, you've taken a small step forward:

![](https://i.imgur.com/196wOkr.png)

Then browse to [http://localhost/api/musics/](http://localhost/api/musics/)

![](https://i.imgur.com/2QGKeex.png)

Seeing this is normal because we still need to migrate.

The terminal output also has no issues (although this is where it's easy to get stuck :sweat_smile:).

![](https://i.imgur.com/RBW8eQt.png)

Next, open another terminal and enter the `api` (Django + uWSGI) container.
For commands, you can refer to the previous [docker-tutorial-command-introduction](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-tutorial#Êåá‰ª§‰ªãÁ¥π).

You can also use other GUI tools like the [previously introduced portainer](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-tutorial#ÂÖ∂‰ªñÁÆ°ÁêÜ-docker-gui-ÁöÑÂ∑•ÂÖ∑).

```cmd
docker exec -it <Container ID> bash
```

```cmd
python manage.py makemigrations musics
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/haHcokf.png)

This time we need to run one more command:

```cmd
python manage.py collectstatic
```

This collects Django's static files into a `static` folder.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zaz2bYX.png)

Now you can browse to [http://localhost/api/musics/](http://localhost/api/musics/) again,
and you will find that it displays normally :smile:

![](https://i.imgur.com/eb7O0g8.png)

Why do we need to perform this step?
The main reason is to hand over these static files to Nginx for processing. In `my_nginx.conf`, you can see that we pointed the path to `/docker_api/static`.

As mentioned earlier,
Nginx is responsible for static content (HTML, CSS, images, etc.), while uWSGI is responsible for Python's dynamic content.

If you're interested, you can try running Django + uWSGI without Nginx. It will still run, but you'll find that all your CSS, images, etc., won't be loaded, as shown below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/rgPfYeT.png)

This is because uWSGI itself is not good at handling static content :sob:
Although it can be solved, see [https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StaticFiles.html](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StaticFiles.html),
it's recommended to use Nginx, as it can do much more :smiley:

## Execution Screenshots

## Real-time Monitoring of Nginx Web Status

* [Youtube Tutorial - NGINX Tutorial - auth basic](https://youtu.be/zWODI3YHb2Y)

Enable the `stub_status` module, please refer to [my_nginx.conf](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uwsgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/my_nginx.conf),

```conf
location /nginx/status {
    # Enable stub_status
    stub_status on;

    # Disable/Enable log
    # access_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/status.log;
    access_log off;

    auth_basic "NginxStatus";

    # Restrict accessible IPs
    # allow 127.0.0.1;
    # deny all;
}
```

Current Nginx connection status:

![](https://i.imgur.com/GWysybq.png)

You can also set which IPs are allowed to access this page. If an IP is not in the list, it will be denied with a 403 error.

![](https://i.imgur.com/iFZF8Yh.png)

### Setting up auth_basic

Mainly add `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_user_file`.
Documentation can be found at [Module ngx_http_auth_basic_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html).

```conf
location /nginx/status {
    # Enable stub_status
    stub_status on;

    # Disable/Enable log
    # access_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/status.log;
    access_log off;

    auth_basic "NginxStatus";
    auth_basic_user_file /my_htpasswd/htpasswd;

    # Restrict accessible IPs
    # allow 127.0.0.1;
    # deny all;
}
```

Create a `htpasswd` file with the following content:

```text
# comment
name1:password1
name2:password2:comment
name3:password3
```

Note that the password needs to be generated using OpenSSL.
For example, if my password is `123`:

```cmd
‚ùØ openssl passwd 123
8uxCGNPhjFqiw
```

Then fill the `htpasswd` file with:

```text
# comment
user1:8uxCGNPhjFqiw:123
```

Restart Nginx, and you will find that you need to enter a username and password to view the page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LKFcUGz.png)

## `hosts` file configuration and finding internal IP

Modify the `hosts` file.

Windows:
The `hosts` path is at

> C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q6lZyK0.png)

You may need administrator privileges to save.

Mac:
The `hosts` path is at
> sudo vi /etc/hosts

Find internal IP:

Windows:

```cmd
ipconfig
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/sPOqIxM.png)

Mac:

```cmd
ifconfig
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/BOs5BwZ.png)

If you see something like `192.168.1.103`, you can access your site via this IP as long as you are on the same network (intranet).
Also, with the `hosts` file modification we just did, we can directly browse to [http://twtrubiks.com/api/musics/](http://twtrubiks.com/api/musics/).

![](https://i.imgur.com/ufKRO9a.png)

## Introduction to Supervisor

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/)

is a process management tool. It makes it easy to start, stop, restart, and monitor one or more processes. If a process dies, Supervisor will automatically restart it without needing any custom scripts (no need to write your own shell scripts for control).

At this point, you'll surely ask me: Should I use it? :confused:
When do you need to use Supervisor?
When you need to start multiple independent processes in the same container, Supervisor is suitable. For example, if you have Nginx + uWSGI + Django all in the same container, you should use Supervisor.

However, with Docker, it's generally recommended to separate Nginx and uWSGI + Django into different containers (i.e., two containers) and manage them with `docker-compose`, which is the approach in this example.

So you might ask, how do I manage a container that terminates unexpectedly? :confused:
You can refer to [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uswgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and use `restart=always`. It will automatically restart the container upon unexpected termination :relaxed:

## CORS Pitfalls Sharing

* [Youtube Tutorial - Django + Nginx + uWSGI CORS Pitfalls Sharing](https://youtu.be/WY2zCVfvu1M)

If you don't understand CORS, please read [Understanding Same-Origin Policy and CORS üìù](https://github.com/twtrubiks/CORS-tutorial) first.

With a Django + Nginx + uWSGI setup, let's consider a question:
Should I configure CORS on Nginx, on Django, or on both? :question:

In the spirit of experimentation, let's try all three scenarios (video recommended):

Method 1: Configure on both (Failure)
If you configure it on both, you will get an error message like this:

```text
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1/api/musics/' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, *', but only one is allowed.
```

Method 2: Configure only on Nginx (Failure)
To configure CORS on Nginx, you can refer to [here](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uwsgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/my_nginx.conf#L37).
Additional notes:

**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**
Allowed domains. For details, see [Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin).

**Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**
For details, see [Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials).

**Access-Control-Allow-Methods**
For details, see [Access-Control-Allow-Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods).

**Access-Control-Allow-Headers**
A preflight request refers to the OPTIONS request sent by CORS.
(If you don't know what a preflight request is, see [Preflight request](https://github.com/twtrubiks/CORS-tutorial#%E9%A0%90%E6%AA%A2%E8%AB%8B%E6%B1%82-preflight-request))
An actual request is the actual request being sent. This refers to the actual request.
For details, see [Access-Control-Allow-Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers).

**Access-Control-Expose-Headers**
Indicates which headers can be exposed as part of the response by making them available to the browser. By default, these headers are available:
`Cache-Control`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified`, `Pragma`.
If you want to access other headers, you must add them manually.
For details, see [Access-Control-Expose-Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers).

**Access-Control-Max-Age**
How long the results of a preflight request can be cached. Within this time, the browser will use the cache.
For details, see [Access-Control-Max-Age](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Max-Age).

If you configure it on Nginx, you will find that your CORS headers are being ignored.

```text
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1/api/musics/' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

I haven't found a solution to this problem yet. Related [issue](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/issues/1550).
(If anyone finds a solution, please let me know, and I'll try it out.)

Method 3: Configure only on Django (Success)
You can configure CORS on Django using `django-cors-headers`. For the method, refer to this [article](https://github.com/twtrubiks/CORS-tutorial#cors).

**Therefore, if your environment is Django + Nginx + uWSGI, it is recommended to configure CORS on Django using `django-cors-headers`.**

## Analyzing PV/UV with Nginx Log

* [Youtube Tutorial - Analyzing PV/UV with Nginx Log](https://youtu.be/mUyDVVX6OD4)

The configuration used can be found in [nginx.conf](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uwsgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/nginx.conf).

```conf
http {
    ......
    log_format  main  '$host $remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                      '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                      '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" '
                      '$request_time';
......
```

I have also provided an example log for you, see [nginx-access.example_log](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uwsgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/nginx-access.example_log).

```log

### PV
Abbreviation for Page View. It can be simply seen as one request equals one PV.

Calculate the total number of PVs:

```cmd
cat nginx-access.example_log | wc -l
```

Calculate the number of PVs for a specific day:

```cmd
cat nginx-access.example_log | sed -n '/05\/Apr\/2022/p' | wc -l
```

Calculate the number of PVs for a specific time range (4-5 o'clock):

```cmd
cat nginx-access.example_log | sed -n '/06\/Apr\/2022:04/,/06\/Apr\/2022:05/p' | wc -l
```

Calculate PVs per second:

```cmd
awk '{print $5}' nginx-access.example_log | cut -c 11-18 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r| head -n 10
```

Calculate PVs per minute:

```cmd
awk '{print $5}' nginx-access.example_log | cut -c 11-15 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r| head -n 10
```

Calculate PVs per hour:

```cmd
awk '{print $5}' nginx-access.example_log | cut -c 11-12 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r| head -n 10
```

`sort` must be executed mainly because of `uniq`. See [uniq](https://github.com/twtrubiks/linux-note#uniq).

### UV
Abbreviation for Unique Visitor. Each visitor is counted only once per day.
Here, we simply use IP to represent a unique visitor.

Calculate UV count based on IP:

```cmd
‚ùØ awk '{print $2}' nginx-access.example_log | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
2
```

### IP

Count the occurrences of each IP:

```cmd
‚ùØ awk '{print $2}' nginx-access.example_log | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      2 172.30.0.1
      2 172.30.0.2
```

Find the top 10 most frequent IPs:
```cmd
awk '{print $2}' nginx-access.example_log | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -n 10
```

Query the visited URL status for a specific IP:

```cmd
grep '172.30.0.2' nginx-access.example_log | awk '{print $8}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
```

### Others

Find the most frequently visited URLs:

```cmd
awk '{print $8}' nginx-access.example_log | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
```

Find the most frequently visited URLs (excluding specific URLs):

```cmd
grep -v "/api/" nginx-access.example_log | awk '{print $8}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
```

Find pages with a transfer time exceeding 0.3 seconds (remember to add `$request_time` to [nginx.conf](https://github.com/twtrubiks/docker-django-nginx-uwsgi-postgres-tutorial/blob/master/nginx/nginx.conf)):

```cmd
‚ùØ cat nginx-access.example_log | awk '($NF > 0.3){print $21}' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -n -r
      1 0.506
      1 0.306
```

Find the most frequently visited host:

```cmd
‚ùØ awk '{print $1}' nginx-access.example_log | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      4 localhost
```

If you are not familiar with these commands, you can refer to [Notes on some linux commands](https://github.com/twtrubiks/linux-note).

## Blocking Malicious Spiders

Some spiders are of very poor quality and can even affect system speed. Here's how to block them.
Add the following to your Nginx configuration (this blocks MJ12bot):

```conf
if ($http_user_agent ~* (MJ12bot) ) {
    return 444;
}
```

`~*` means case-insensitive.
`~` means case-sensitive.

If you want to ban many spiders:

```conf
if ($http_user_agent ~* (MJ12bot|Semrush|DataForSeo|Yandex|Ahrefs|Petal|Dot)){
     return 444;
}
```

(Some people use HTTP response code 410, but it seems more people use 444)

After restarting Nginx, use the following command to check if it's successful:

```cmd
‚ùØ curl -I -A 'mj12bot' YOUR_DOMAIN
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

Other examples:

```cmd
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; SemrushBot/6~bl; +http://www.semrush.com/bot.html)" YOUR_DOMAIN

curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; AhrefsBot/7.0; +http://ahrefs.com/robot/)" YOUR_DOMAIN

curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0;) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; PetalBot;+https://webmaster.petalsearch.com/site/petalbot)" YOUR_DOMAIN
```

`-I`, `--head` Show document info only.
`-A`, `--user-agent <name>` Send User-Agent <name> to server.

If successfully blocked, it will show the same as above.
If not successfully blocked, it will show a normal 200.

## Afterword:

This was my first time setting up Django + Nginx + uWSGI + Postgres, and it took me a long time to figure everything out :scream:. But I genuinely recommend Docker. Playing with this setup in Docker is amazing. If you mess up, you can just delete everything and start over. It's super fast. Through this exercise, everyone should also see that Nginx has many features to play with, like Load Balancing, which can help you understand servers better. I also realized through this that there's still a lot I don't know. In short, I recommend everyone to follow my steps and try it out. I believe you will gain something from it. I'm also a Docker newbie, so if I've said anything wrong, please let me know, and I will correct it :blush:
